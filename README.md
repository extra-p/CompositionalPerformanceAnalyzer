# CompositionalPerformanceAnalyzer

This code exemplifies the possibility of composing performance models along parallel design patterns.
It does so by providing a convinient interface to implement parallel design patterns and nest them recursively.

This code is developed by [TU Darmstadt](https://www.parallel.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) – 
in collaboration with [ETH Zurich](https://spcl.inf.ethz.ch/).
